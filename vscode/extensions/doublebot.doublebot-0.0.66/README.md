[Double](https://www.double.bot/) is an AI-powered coding assistant inside of [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=doublebot.doublebot), designed to generate high quality code and assist you with programming tasks.

## Models

Double is powered by the most capable commercially available LLMs, providing state of the art coding assistance. We will never waste your precious time with inferior models.

At this time we support GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3 (Opus). You can read more about our models [here](https://docs.double.bot/models).


## Code Autocomplete 

Get code suggestions in real time as you type in the editor, press `Tab` to accept a suggestion and incorporate it into your code. The suggestions are personalized to your file's context and style conventions. 

Double's autocomplete is also handles multi-cursor mode, naming variables, mid-line completions, and automatically imports any relevant functions, variables, and libraries needed to run the code. You can read more about autocomplete [here](https://docs.double.bot/features/autocomplete).

## Control the Context

Select the exact lines you want the AI to focus on. `Cmd + Shift + M` passes any highlighted code in the editor to the AI. You can also read more about other keybindings [here](https://docs.double.bot/features/keybindings). Try asking it to:

- Generate tests for a highlighted function
- Add comments to the highlighted code
- Explain how the highlighted code works
